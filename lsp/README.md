# go-lsp

**This is a modified vendored copy of go-lsp. It's needed due to missing and outdated LSP models in sourcegraph's implementation.**

Package lsp contains Go types for the messages used in the Language Server
Protocol.

See
https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md
for more information.
